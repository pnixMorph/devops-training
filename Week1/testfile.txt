Commit Your Changes: Now, when you try to commit your changes using git commit, the pre-commit hook script will run your chosen code formatter on the staged files. If the formatting does not meet your standards, the commit will be rejected until the code is properly formatted.

Remember that the specific implementation of code formatting and the tool you use may vary depending on your project's requirements and the programming language you're working with. The example above demonstrates a general approach using a pre-commit hook and clang-format. You can adapt it to your project's needs and tools of choice.
